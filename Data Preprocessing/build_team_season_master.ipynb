    "This notebook creates a single **team-season** dataset by stacking and joining multiple NFL team stat tables stored by season (2015–2025).  \n",
    "The final output will contain **one row per team per season**, combining:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Team Performance (outcomes + baseline season info)\n",
    "- Offense + Defense split metrics\n",
    "- Passing and Rushing splits (offense and defense)\n",
    "- Defensive Advanced metrics (available starting in later seasons)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Strategy\n",
    "1. **Stack first**: for each stat category, combine all seasons into one dataframe and add a `season` column.\n",
    "2. **Standardize keys**: normalize column names and team identifiers.\n",
    "3. **Prefix features**: add prefixes (e.g., `off_`, `def_`, `pass_off_`) to avoid column collisions.\n",
    "4. **Join** all stat tables to Team Performance on `season + team`.\n",
    "5. Validate that the final dataset remains at the **team-season grain** (no duplicated keys)."

    "\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This ensures inclusion of only overall defensive totals and exclusion of:\n",

    "### Cleaning Steps Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removed Summary Rows**\n",
    "   - Rows such as “Avg Team” or “League Total” were removed by requiring `Rk` (Rank) to be numeric.\n",
    "   - This guarantees exactly one row per team per season.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Dropped Ranking Column (`Rk`)**\n",
    "   - The `Rk` column was removed because it represents relative ranking and may introduce unintended signal or leakage into modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Excluded Pass/Rush Blocks Within the File**\n",
    "   - Although duplicate column groups existed due to pass/rush breakdowns, these were intentionally ignored.\n",
    "   - Pass and rush defensive splits are handled separately via their own files.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicit Column Selection**\n",
    "   Only the following overall defensive totals were retained:\n",
    "   `G, PA, Yds, Ply, Y/P, TO, FL, Pen, Yds.3, 1stPy, Sc%, TO%, EXP`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Yds` was mapped to total yards allowed.\n",
    "- `Yds.3` was explicitly identified and mapped as penalty yards.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Namespaced with `def_` Prefix**\n",
    "- All retained features were renamed using a `def_` prefix (e.g., `def_pa`, `def_yds_allowed`) to prevent column collisions during dataset merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stacked dataset contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **256 rows** (32 teams × 8 seasons)\n",
    "- One row per `(season, team)`\n",
    "- Clean, namespaced overall defensive features\n",
    "- No duplicated keys\n",

    "\n",
    "Only the overall offense file (`YYYY Offense.csv`) is processed in this step. Passing and rushing splits are handled separately via:\n",
    "- `YYYY Pass Offense.csv`\n",
    "- `YYYY Rush Offense.csv`\n",
    "\n",
    "This avoids duplication and ensures that split metrics come from their dedicated sources.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Steps Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Removed Section Header Rows**\n",
    "   - Some files include an extra top row used to label sections (e.g., Passing / Rushing / Penalties).\n",
    "   - The true header row was detected by locating the row containing `Rk` and using it as the dataframe header.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Removed Summary Rows**\n",
    "   - Rows such as “Avg Team” or “League Total” were removed by requiring `Rk` to be numeric.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dropped Ranking Column (`Rk`)**\n",
    "   - The `Rk` column was removed to avoid introducing ranking-based signal into modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Explicit Column Selection (Overall Totals Only)**\n",
    "   Only the following overall offensive totals were retained:\n",
    "`G, Pts, Yds, Ply, Y/P, TO, FL, Pen, Yds.3, 1stPy, Sc%, TO%, EXP`\n",
    "\n",
    "- `Yds` was mapped to total offensive yards.\n",
    "- `Yds.3` was explicitly identified and mapped as penalty yards.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Feature Namespaced with `off_` Prefix**\n",
    "- All retained features were renamed using an `off_` prefix to prevent column collisions during dataset merges.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "The final stacked dataset contains:\n",
    "- One row per `(season, team)`\n",
    "- Clean, namespaced overall offensive features\n",
    "- No duplicated keys\n",

    "Before merging all stacked datasets, team names were standardized to ensure consistent `(season, team)` keys across all tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "During auditing, it was observed that the `Team Performance` table contained additional marker characters (e.g., `*`, `+`) appended to team names, while other tables did not. These markers are typically used in source tables to indicate playoff appearances, division winners, or seeding information.\n",
    "\n",
    "This caused inflated unique team counts and potential merge mismatches.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Issues Identified\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Playoff/Seeding Markers**\n",
    "   - Examples:\n",
    "     - `Baltimore Ravens*`\n",
    "     - `Arizona Cardinals+`\n",
    "   - These symbols do not represent distinct franchises and must be removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Franchise Name Changes (2018–2025 Window)**\n",
    "   - `Washington Football Team` → `Washington Commanders`\n",
    "   - `Oakland Raiders` → `Las Vegas Raiders`\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the project is restricted to seasons **2018–2025**, no normalization was required for:\n",
    "- San Diego / Los Angeles Chargers (move occurred in 2017)\n",
    "- St. Louis / Los Angeles Rams (move occurred in 2016)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Steps Applied\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Stripped whitespace from team names.\n",
    "2. Removed trailing marker characters (`*`, `+`) using regex.\n",
    "3. Applied a controlled franchise mapping dictionary for known name changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Result\n",
    "\n",
    "After normalization:\n",
    "- All tables contain exactly **32 unique team names**.\n",
    "- No mismatches exist across datasets.\n",
    "- `(season, team)` is now a stable and reliable merge key.\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures the master dataset can be constructed without row loss or duplication due to naming inconsistencies."
