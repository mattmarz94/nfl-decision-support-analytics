# nfl-decision-support-analytics

A decision-support analytics project analyzing NFL team performance and draft outcomes using public Pro-Football-Reference data. The project follows the CRISP-DM framework and prioritizes business understanding, probabilistic evaluation, and transparent, reproducible analysis.

This repository contains a decision-support analytics project examining team performance and draft outcomes in the National Football League (NFL) using publicly available data from Pro-Football-Reference. The project is structured as a CRISP-DM case study, with a primary focus on the Business Understanding and Data Understanding phases that establish the foundation for subsequent modeling work.

The primary objective is to analyze and model team-level outcomes such as regular-season wins and playoff qualification while accounting for contextual factors including strength of schedule, point differential, and offensive and defensive efficiency. Rather than producing deterministic predictions, the analysis emphasizes probabilistic reasoning and risk-aware evaluation to better reflect the variability inherent in NFL performance.

A secondary objective is to evaluate NFL draft selection “hit rates” using career outcome proxies derived from public data. This component explores how draft position, round, and player position relate to long-term player value, providing a structured framework for assessing draft investment and roster-building efficiency. Draft analysis is designed to complement team outcome modeling by examining how personnel decisions may contribute to sustained team success.

The project adopts the perspective of an independent sports analytics consultant, prioritizing objective evaluation, interpretability, and reproducibility. All data processing and analytical decisions are documented, and limitations of public data and non-causal interpretations are explicitly acknowledged. The repository includes cleaned datasets, exploratory analyses, reproducible notebooks, and written reports intended for both technical and non-technical audiences.
